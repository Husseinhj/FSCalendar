# Documentations

This is the powerful, easy and elegant calendar for **iOS** platform. We changed the [FSCalendar](https://github.com/WenchaoD/FSCalendar) for supporting **Righ to Left** calendars such as Persian and Arabic and also support FSCalendar last versions. Thanks to [@WenchaoD](https://github.com/WenchaoD) to create this awesome calendar we just change some part of codes and create useful documenate for **FSCalander** which has support **RTL** calendars.

Please follow read the documentation and see the examples of each feature. Don't forget [star the FSCalendar](https://github.com/WenchaoD/FSCalendar) project to send [@WenchaoD](https://github.com/WenchaoD).
